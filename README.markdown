# The Caves of Clojure

The code for Steve Losh's [Caves of Clojure][caves] series of blog posts.

[caves]: http://stevelosh.com/blog/

## Usage

Clone the repo.

Run `lein deps` to pull down deps.

Follow along with the entries by using tags:

    git checkout entry-06

That will put you at the code as it stood right at the *end* of entry number
six, so you can see how it all works together.
